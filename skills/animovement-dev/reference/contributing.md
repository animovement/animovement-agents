# Contributing to animovement

Contributions are very welcome — whether fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving the documentation. This guide applies to every repository in the [animovement](https://github.com/animovement) organisation.

**If your favourite type of movement data is not supported yet, we would love a sample of your data so we can support it.** That is one of the most useful contributions you can make.

## Before you start

Check the issue tracker to see whether an issue already describes what you have in mind.

- If it does, comment to say you would like to work on it.
- If it does not, open one describing your idea.

If you use AI tools while contributing, please read the [AI use policy and guidelines](https://github.com/animovement/.github/blob/main/AI.md) first. Short version: use whatever tools you like, but understand and test what you submit, and talk to us yourself.

We strongly encourage discussing your plans before writing code — in the issue, or on our [Zulip chat](https://animovement.zulipchat.com). This avoids duplicated effort and makes sure the work fits where the project is going. If you are not sure whether an issue is ready to be worked on, just ask.

### Which repository?

animovement is a suite of packages, each owning one stage of the pipeline:

| Package | Owns |
|---|---|
| [aniframe](https://github.com/animovement/aniframe) | The core data structures and metadata |
| [aniread](https://github.com/animovement/aniread) | Reading and writing movement data |
| [anicheck](https://github.com/animovement/anicheck) | Data-quality diagnostics |
| [aniprocess](https://github.com/animovement/aniprocess) | Signal processing and filtering |
| [anispace](https://github.com/animovement/anispace) | Spatial transformations |
| [animetric](https://github.com/animovement/animetric) | Movement metrics |
| [anivis](https://github.com/animovement/anivis) | Visualisation |
| [animovement](https://github.com/animovement/animovement) | The meta-package that bundles them |

File the issue against the package that owns the behaviour. If you are unsure, open it against [animovement](https://github.com/animovement/animovement/issues) and we will move it.

## Contributing code

### Setting up

Fork and clone the repository, then install the package with its dependencies. The animovement packages are published on [R-universe](https://animovement.r-universe.dev) rather than CRAN, so that repository has to be named:

```r
options(repos = c(
  animovement = "https://animovement.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()          # dependencies of the package in the working directory
devtools::load_all()
devtools::test()
```

Some repositories carry an `renv.lock`. You do not need renv to contribute — it records a known-good set of versions for reproducing a specific environment, and CI resolves dependencies from `DESCRIPTION` rather than from the lockfile.

### Pull requests

Please submit changes as a pull request against `main`.

- Create a branch for your work. `usethis::pr_init("brief-description")` sets this up.
- Keep a pull request to one logical change. Several small ones are easier to review, and get merged faster, than one large one.
- The title should briefly describe the change; the body should say why it is needed.
- If it closes an issue, put `Fixes #issue-number` in the body.
- For any user-facing change, add a bullet to `NEWS.md` under `# (development version)`, in the style described in the [tidyverse NEWS guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html).

Every pull request runs `R CMD check` on Linux, macOS and Windows, builds the pkgdown site, reports test coverage, and checks formatting. All of these must pass before merging.

### Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), so that release notes can be drafted from the history and version bumps follow from what actually changed.

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
```

The types we use:

| Type | Use for | Version effect |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | A new user-facing capability — an exported function, a new argument | Minor |
| `fix` | A bug fix in behaviour a user could hit | Patch |
| `docs` | Roxygen comments, vignettes, README, this guide | None |
| `perf` | A change that makes existing behaviour faster | Patch |
| `refactor` | Internal restructuring with no change in behaviour | None |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | None |
| `build` | `DESCRIPTION`, dependencies, packaging | None |
| `ci` | Workflows and their stubs | None |
| `chore` | Anything else that touches no user-facing behaviour | None |
| `revert` | Undoing an earlier commit | Matches what it undoes |

A **breaking change** — a removed or renamed export, a changed default, a different return type — takes a `!` before the colon (`feat(aniframe)!: …`) and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer explaining the migration. Those are the ones that force a major bump, so they are worth spelling out.

The scope is optional and is normally the package name (`fix(aniread): …`), or the area within a package when that is more useful (`fix(read_sleap): …`).

- Write the description in the imperative — *add*, not *added* or *adds* — and lower-case, with no trailing full stop.
- Describe the change, not the file: `fix(aniprocess): keep metadata through filter_kalman()` rather than `fix: update filter-kalman.R`.

**The pull request title must follow the same format**, and matters more than the individual commits: merges here squash, so the title becomes the commit that lands on `main`. A workflow checks it, and will tell you what is wrong. Commits within a branch are squashed away, so tidy them if you like, but do not agonise over them.

`NEWS.md` is still written by hand, for users, in the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html) — the commit history drafts release notes, it does not replace them.

### Two commands that save round trips

Comment on your pull request and a maintainer-triggered workflow will fix things for you:

- **`/document`** re-runs roxygen and pushes the regenerated `man/` and `NAMESPACE`.
- **`/style`** reformats the package with air and pushes the result.

Both require a maintainer to run them, so ask in the pull request if you would like them applied.

### Code style

We follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) — for code here, and for
documentation in the next section.

- **Formatting** is handled by [air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), which implements that guide,
  so the two never disagree. Every pull request is checked and suggestions are posted inline. Please
  do not reformat code unrelated to your change.
- **Documentation** uses [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) with Markdown syntax. Edit the
  roxygen comments in `R/`, never the generated `.Rd` files in `man/`.
- **Tests** use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org). Contributions that come with tests are much
  easier to accept.
- **Before a substantial change lands**, it is worth running [goodpractice](https://docs.ropensci.org/goodpractice/) over the package:

  ```r
  # install.packages("goodpractice")
  goodpractice::gp()          # from the package root
  ```

  It includes lintr, and by default that means a lot of formatting complaints that air already
  settles. To keep the useful checks without the noise:

  ```r
  formatting <- c(
    "brace", "commas", "function_left_parentheses", "indentation", "infix_spaces",
    "line_length", "paren_body", "pipe_consistency", "pipe_continuation", "quotes",
    "semicolon", "spaces_inside", "spaces_left_parentheses", "trailing_blank_lines",
    "trailing_whitespace", "whitespace"
  )
  noisy <- paste0("tidyverse_", formatting, "_linter")
  goodpractice::gp(checks = setdiff(goodpractice::all_checks(), noisy))
  ```

  That drops 16 formatting checks and keeps the semantic ones — `tidyverse_seq_linter`, which
  catches `1:length(x)` counting backwards on empty input, is worth the price of admission on
  its own.

  It runs `R CMD check`, lintr, cyclomatic complexity and coverage together, and reports things like print methods that don't return invisibly, unused internal functions, or untested code. Read it critically rather than treating every line as a defect — it flags `.onAttach` as uncalled, and counts roxygen comments as over-long lines. It is not part of CI for that reason.

- Function naming follows the verb prefixes each package owns — `read_`, `filter_`, `calculate_`, `check_`, `plot_` and so on. Match the surrounding code.

### Documentation style

We follow the [tidyverse guide to documentation](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html):
titles in sentence case without a full stop, `@param` and `@return` written as sentences,
cross-links in preference to code font, `@noRd` on internal functions, `@family` to group related
ones. It is short, and it pairs with the code style above — air implements the same guide, so the
formatter and the written rules cannot disagree.

Everything below is what that guide does not cover.

**Every exported function needs an example and a `@return`.** Examples are executed by
`R CMD check`, so they are the part of the documentation that cannot quietly stop being true. Run
them with `devtools::run_examples()`.

**Document defaults in the parameter.** "A logical value (default `TRUE`) determining whether…"
rather than leaving the reader to find it in the signature.

**Examples take an aniframe from `example_aniframe()`**, at the smallest shape that makes the point:

```r
#' @examples
#' af <- aniframe::example_aniframe(n_obs = 5, n_individuals = 1, n_keypoints = 1)
#' map_to_polar(af)
```

**Namespace that call.** Under `R CMD check` only the documented package is attached, so an
unqualified `example_aniframe()` fails everywhere except in aniframe itself. For functions taking
plain vectors or data frames, write the input inline.

**`@return` should name what changed.** Nearly everything here returns an aniframe, so the type
alone says little:

```r
#' @return An aniframe with `rho` and `phi` in place of `x` and `y`.
```

not "An aniframe" or "The transformed data".

**Avoid `\dontrun{}`.** It hides the example from `R CMD check`, so it rots unnoticed. Reserve it
for examples that genuinely cannot run there — network access, a file the user supplies, something
interactive — and prefer `@examplesIf` where the condition can be tested.

**Where documentation belongs.** Function reference lives with the code as roxygen comments.
Tutorials spanning several packages live on [animovement.dev](https://animovement.dev) — see
*Contributing documentation* below.

### Issues and pull requests

Please use the templates. They exist so that a report has what is needed to act on it — a reproducible example and `animovement_sitrep()` output for a bug, the *why* rather than the *what* for a pull request. Filling them in properly is the single biggest thing that gets a contribution reviewed quickly. This applies equally if you are drafting with an AI assistant: complete the template rather than replacing it with generated prose. See the [AI use policy](AI.md).

Maintainers cutting a release should open a **Release checklist** issue from the template and work through it.

## Contributing documentation

Documentation is split deliberately:

- **Function reference** lives with the code, as roxygen comments, on each package's own site.
- **Tutorials and guides that span packages** live on [animovement.dev](https://animovement.dev), in the [website repository](https://github.com/animovement/animovement.github.io).

So a fix to what a function does belongs in the package; a new worked example belongs on the hub.
